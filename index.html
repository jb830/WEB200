					<h1>Laura's story</h1>
					<p>
						<br>Laura grew up in the Sierra Nevada foothills of Northern California on a 10acre mini farm with her parents and six siblings. She was homeschooled much of her life and spent a great deal of her childhood in nature climbing trees, playing in creeks and venturing through tall grass meadows. Her childhood experiences instilled a deep love for the outdoors that continues to inspire her creativity in many mediums.  
						
						<br>Laura has an eclectic range of interests including song writing, painting, fire dancing, acting, cake decorating and photography. From an early age, she was drawn to poetry and began writing her own at age seven. By age 13 she taught herself to play guitar and started to write her own songs. As a teen she played in a band and managed the open mic at a local coffee shop where she gained inspiration from many artists.   
						
						<br>In 2011, after meeting her husband, Jesse, she gave birth to their daughter, Addie, and spent the first 4 years as a family in Santa Cruz, California, where she learned graphic design and cared for her daughter at home. Briefly, she worked as an independent actor in the bay area while pursuing her A.A. in liberal arts. After a 6-month journey around the country in 2018, Laura and her family re-located to the Olympic Peninsula of WA, where they still reside. 
						
						<br>Currently, Laura works as the front office manager at an acupuncture clinic while studying to become an elementary school teacher.   

						<br>She is passionate about developing creative curriculum and teaching in a way that nurtures wholeness, confidence, curiosity and happiness in children.
